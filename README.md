Introduction:

In today's data-driven world, real-time analytics and insights have become crucial for businesses. To
facilitate this, organizations often need to stream data from various sources into a central data
warehouse. However, building infrastructure and code for streaming pipelines can get very challenging
because of the complex nature of streaming architectures which often involves integrating with tools
such as Apache Kafka, Flink, Spark etc. as well building the expertise to write high quality code to
integrate and manage these technologies.

In this article, we will explore the process of streaming data from MySQL to Snowflake Data Cloud
platform using the Snowflakeâ€™s Streaming Ingest API SDK. This new Streaming Ingest SDK from
Snowflake is built on Java and so it requires the user to have expertise in Java programming in order to
build an app that can stream data directly into Snowflake. However, this guide will provide you with a
step-by-step approach to achieve seamless and efficient data streaming just using python and pandas
dataframes.
